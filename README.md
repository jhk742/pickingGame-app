A game between two players where the first person to reach a certain score-count (default=100) wins.
- Press 'New Game' at the top to start a new game.
- There are two players, PLAYER 1 & PLAYER 2.

## HOW-TO-PLAY
Player 1 always rolls first and can roll as many times as they want by pressing the 'ROLL DICE' button. 

Each click willrender the image of a dice, the value of which will be added to the corresponding player's "CURRENT" score.

If the dice lands on a 1, the player's current scorecount is reset to 0 and the turn is handed over to the next player. 

Players also get the option to hold, allowing them to keep their current score as is and hand off the turn (dice rolls) to the 
opposing player.

First player to reach 100 points wins.
